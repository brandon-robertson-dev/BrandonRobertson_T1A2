## Before Assignment

### Passion Project
We had a mentor session with Jo Dunham where she talked about just practicing her skills by making something fun.
I liked that advice so much that night I started planning my own passion project to test my skills.
It was originally going to be a clone of the game Resident Evil but made as a text based survival horror/adventure game.
I went with Resident Evil because I've always loved the series but also because of the simplistic idea across the game.

## Plan 1
***Date:*** 20th, April 2020
### 'RESIDENTIAL EVILS'
We received the T1A2 assignment today and I'm thinking of turning my passion project into a class project.
I will have to downscale it by a lot as we only have a week plus we have to document the development of it and do tests.
I think I can make it work though.

#### Update 1
Might have to start thinking about other plans, I've just spent the last few hours trying to get certain methods and classes working but nothing is carrying over.
I attempted it with Global Variables and it started to work but I don't feel comfortable relying on globals for the entire project.

### Changing RESIDENTIAL plans
I spoke to Carl this morning about changing my idea because I really thought about it and it wasn't worth risking not having anything to hand in to merge this passion project with a class project.
Carl then gave me an idea of a sorting app so that gave me the idea of a list making app with a sorting function.

#### Update 1
Planning out some function I want it to have on Trello, I like the idea of having different lists such as a Shopping list, ToDo list and a Bucket list and then a way to export them to a file.

#### Update 2
I've also decided to make the Bucket list a Hash so I can have different levels of importance for the items.

### Little More Planning, a Whole Lotta Testing
I would like to try and add deleting items from the lists or getting rid of the list and starting again completely.
I finally understand writing tests before writing code, I struggled so hard to understand it in the conference as I am a physical learner so now that it's in practice I get it.

#### Update 1
I've written some tests but a lot of the code I am writing is fairly easy to work with so I haven't really been returning any errors.

### Gotta Sort It Out!
Today I'm working on adding a sort function to my app, that lets the user sort by Alphabetical, Reverse Alphabetical, String length shortest to longest and Longest to shortest.
I added tty-prompt to make it easier and faster for the user to go through the menus.
I want to add some more prettiness to it so it doesn't just look like lines of text as an app and definitely more colours!

#### Update 1
I added the sort function, it all works great. I didn't add it to the Bucket List as the bucket list on input sorts it via the importance already.

### Remove It or Lose It
Today I added my remove from list function to the app. Lets the user remove something from their list.
Been trying to think of other functions to add to it.

***Date:*** 25th, April 2020
### Finding Gems and Other Little Treasures
I added Lolize gem to colour the welcome and exit titles, Colorize gem to the menu options of tty-prompt gem.
Updating gemfile and documentation as well today.
I finally got git commit/push to work, I don't know why it took me so long but it's done.

***Date:*** 26th, April 2020
### Finishing of Documentation
Finishing of all my documentation, because I only got my git commit/push thing to work yesterday just finishing up my documents and code and getting everything organised to hand in tomorrow.

***Date:*** 27th, April 2020
### THE FINAL CHAPTER
Today I am finalizing my documentation, doing my help file, filling out my readme a bit more, uploading screenshots of Trello and my workflow chart.
Keep going through my app just to make sure its working even though I know it works but I ended up finding a softlock I had made for when you tried to remove something from an empty list but that is all fixed now.

#### Update 1
Everything is now done, I'm kind of worried to submit it because I feel like more can always be done but I am happy where it's at.
I'm excited for the next build to really dig in, plan and test before everything. It's a new process to me but I need to work on it more.
